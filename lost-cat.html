			<p>These tips should also work for birds, bunnies, reptiles and other small pets (not dogs). For more lost bird tips, see <a href="http://www.cafabirdclub.org/lost.htm">here.</a></p>

			<p>Searching for a lost cat is much different than searching for a lost dog. Your cat is likely very close by. A scared, sick or injured cat will usually hide in silence in a familiar place.</p>

			<p>Physically searching any likely hiding places is the best way to recover your lost cat. Don't give up if you don't find your cat right away - cats often don't show themselves until 7-10 days later. BE PERSISTENT.</p>

			<p>To find a lost cat, follow these steps:</p>
		
				<ul>
					<li>Search every bit of your home and yard - even places you don't think your cat could be. Cats are ninjas. They are experts at hiding silently and can get into places that you'd think are too small. A scared cat will not answer when you call him. Think close - start on your block. Search at night with a flashlight - your cat's eyes will reflect the light and make him easier to see.</li>

					<li>Use a wildlife / trail camera to record your backyard at night. This will let you know if your cat is nearby but only coming out at night.</li>

					<li>Search your neighbors' yards, garages, sheds, etc. Your cat may have been accidentally locked in. (Ask permission first.) Don't expect your neighbors to search as well as you will.</li>

					<li>Hang big neon signs (like yard sale signs) on street corners nearby. These will be noticed more than small white flyers. <a href="http://www.missingpetpartnership.org/recovery-tips/posters-5555/">More info on posters.</a></li>

					<li>Talk to your neighbors - they may have seen your cat. Leave mini-flyers with them - you can print them 4 to a page.</li>

					<li>Check nearby shelters rignt away (in California strays are only held for 72 hours before going up for adoption.) Leave a flyer at the shelter and fill out a lost cat report. KEEP CHECKING BACK! Since cats tend to hide, they often don't end up in the shelter until weeks or months later, after their owners have given up. If your local shelter uses <a href="http://www.petharbor.com/" target="_blank">Petharbor</a> you can check online.</li>

					<li>List your cat with <a href="http://www.helpinglostpets.com/">Helping Lost Pets</a> (HeLP), a nationwide map-based database for lost pets. When you register your pet with HeLP, your pet's photo and info are added to the map. Free flyers are available for download in several formats. And an alert is emailed to everyone who has signed up to receive them. When our volunteers get the alert, we post your pet's photo and info on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/californialostcats">Facebook page</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/calostcats">Twitter feed</a>.</li>
	
					<li>Post a LOST ad on <a href="http://geo.craigslist.org/iso/us/ca" target="_blank">Craigslist</a> and check the Pets and Lost &amp; Found sections for FOUND ads daily.</a></li>
				</ul>
					

			<p>The steps above should work most of the time. Once you have done them, here are more things you can do:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>If your cat is microchipped, call the microchip company. Make sure they have your current contact info, and tell them that your cat is lost. They can put a "lost" alert on the chip and may also notify local vets and shelters, as well as their email lists, about your missing cat.</li>
			
				<li>Send out a 'pet amber alert' with a service such as <a href="http://www.lostmydoggie.com/index.cfm?shelterid=431" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lost My Doggie</a> or <a href="https://www.findtoto.com/shelters/jrox.php?id=441_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Find Toto</a>. They will call all homes in the neighborhood to alert them of your lost cat.</li>
			
			
				<li>Post your cat on other lost &amp; found sites and local Facebook pages and groups. <a href="http://www.lostpetsofcalifornia.com/more-places-to-post-lost-found-pets/" target="_blank">Here's a list of more sites.</a></li>
			</ul>
